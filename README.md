# We-need-to-go-deeper
Coming from a movie named 'Inception',"We need to go deeper"implies my dedicated determination in deep learning.
Being a totally freshman in deeplearning,I am unfortunately told I am about to gradute from school in like a year(maybe longer even never lol). 
Fancied by the magic of AI(high salary offer), I decide to take part in the flood of DL though my major is called somewhat Biosystem Engineering shit.I take no advantage in CS,whereas,I gotta make a damn plan to dealing with my weakness meanwhile recording my learning track.So this is more like a diary for recording what I've learned today.Even for some occasions I don't keep diary Like dating a fancy girl,having a hangover even being desperate for my goddamn life,I hope DL never goes die,nether will my fucking diary.

I'll catch U guys up soon,U bunch of motherfuckers.

For the first day,I decide to learn..oh wait I choose to take a rest at first..umm,this gonna be a great start for the wonderful journey.

Thx for Lao tie men!
