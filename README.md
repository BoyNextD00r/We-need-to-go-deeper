# We-need-to-go-deeper
Coming from a movie named 'Inception',"We need to go deeper"implies my dedicated determination in deep learning.
Being a totally freshman in deeplearning,I am unfortunately told I am about to gradute from school in like a year(maybe longer lol). 
Fancied by the magic of AI(high salary offer), I decide to take part in the flood of DL though my major is called somewhat Biosystem Engineering.I take no advantage in CS,whereas,I gotta make a damn plan to dealing with my weakness meanwhile recording my learning track.
So this is more like a diary for recording what I've learned today.Even for sometime I don't keep diary Like dating a fancy girl,having a hangover,I hope deep learning never go die,nether will my fucking diary.
I'll catch U guys up soon,U bunch of motherfuckers.
